    title: "iOS 16.4 Second Test Hints Superb New iPhone Feature Is Near",
    content: `Apple has just issued a second test of its superb new security feature, Rapid Security Response, in the iOS 16.4 Beta version. The latest test of the feature was released on Monday afternoon, according to a report on Apple-focused site AppleInsider. It is the second test of Rapid Security Response in the iOS 16.4 Beta, following Apple’s first fix issued a week ago. The iPhone maker has now released four known Rapid Security Reponses since the feature was first announced with iOS 16 last Fall. In case you haven’t seen it yet, Rapid Security Response is a new way for Apple to quickly squash iPhone bugs on the fly, without having to issue a big update. As I mentioned previously, the feature is available on your iPhone if you go to Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates and toggle on Security Responses & System Files.
    The ability to rapidly update iPhones with security fixes is welcome. As Apple devices continue to grow in popularity, attackers are increasingly finding ways to compromise iPhones. Apple is pretty good at getting upgrades out quickly, but it’s resulting in multiple emergency updates to fix major flaws already being used in attacks—iOS 16.3.1 is just one example of this.
    The iOS 16.4 update is coming later this month or in early April, along with a bunch of superb new features. Could one of these be the ability to update iPhones with Rapid Security Responses? Maybe—I am certainly hoping the new iOS 16 feature is finally ready to go.`,

    title: "WhatsApp Will Soon Let Users Choose when Group Chats Will Expire",
    content: `If you've ever created or joined a WhatsApp group chat for a single event, then kept forgetting to delete it for years afterwards, there's an upcoming feature you may appreciate. We've asked WhatsApp parent company Meta for comment. This is the first beta to mention the Newsletter feature, so it may not be ready to test for a while. There's also no guarantee WhatsApp will release newsletters as a finished product.

      If this does go ahead, it won't be surprising. WhatsApp is as much a source of information as it is a messaging service, with users frequently forwarding messages and receiving news through group discussions. Newsletters would effectively streamline some of that info delivery. Meta has also spent years pivoting toward privacy-oriented services, including communities that can link multiple group chats. The addition could expand WhatsApp's functionality without turning it into a Facebook-style social network.`,
